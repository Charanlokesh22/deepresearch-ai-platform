DeepResearch AI

A production-grade AI research platform that autonomously gathers, analyzes, and summarizes information from multiple sources. Built using FastAPI for backend APIs, Python-based multi-agent architecture for autonomous crawling and summarization, and Elasticsearch for data storage.

How It Works

This system allows users to enter a research topic.
The backend coordinates multiple AI agents:

Web crawler agent – fetches relevant pages while respecting robots.txt guidelines.

Summarizer agent – uses NLP models to condense long documents.

Data analyst agent – organizes findings into structured formats for reports.

The processed data is stored in Elasticsearch and made available through REST APIs.
The frontend (optional) can display results in a clean dashboard or export them as downloadable reports.

Features

Autonomous multi-agent system for research automation.

FastAPI backend for API orchestration and service integration.

Elasticsearch storage for high-speed search and retrieval.

AI-powered summarization for quick insights.

Topic-based structured reporting.

Dockerized deployment for portability.

Security

API key-based authentication for backend endpoints.

Restricted crawler behavior to comply with robots.txt guidelines.

Sanitized data pipelines to prevent injection attacks.

Installation Steps

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/deepresearch-ai.git
cd deepresearch-ai

Start the application using Docker:
docker-compose up --build

Access the API at:
http://localhost:8000

Usage

Authenticate using your API key.

Send a POST request to /research with your topic.

Retrieve structured research summaries and downloadable reports.

AI Agents

Crawler Agent – Gathers topic-relevant documents.

Summarizer Agent – Condenses long texts using NLP.

Analyst Agent – Structures and organizes findings for final output.
