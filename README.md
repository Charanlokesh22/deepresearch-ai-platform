Autonomous AI Research Agent with Multi-Source Data Analysis (DeepResearch AI)

A production-ready multi-agent AI system that can autonomously research any topic end-to-end â€” from gathering information across multiple sources to summarizing findings and generating a citation-backed report. Built using Python for backend orchestration, LangChain for agent coordination, Elasticsearch for indexing and searching data, and React for a dynamic web interface.

How It Works

This system automates the research process by:

Crawling the web and using APIs to collect relevant information.
Processing and summarizing content using advanced NLP techniques.
Scoring sources based on credibility and relevance.
Compiling results into a well-structured PDF or HTML report with citations.

The application follows a modular multi-agent architecture:
Search Agent: Finds and retrieves relevant web pages and documents.
Analysis Agent: Extracts facts, detects key points, and identifies important entities.
Writing Agent: Generates human-readable summaries and report sections.
Indexing Agent: Stores processed data in Elasticsearch for fast retrieval.
Orchestration Layer: Coordinates agents using LangChain pipelines.

Features

Web crawling with respect for robots.txt compliance.
API integrations for scholarly databases and news feeds.
NLP-based summarization and fact extraction.
Source credibility scoring system.
Multi-agent processing pipeline for parallel task execution.
Auto-generated reports in PDF and HTML format.
REST API for triggering and monitoring research tasks.


Installation Steps

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deepresearch-ai-platform.git
cd deepresearch-ai-platform

Set up environment variables in a .env file:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200

Start the backend services:
docker-compose up --build

Access the application:
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api


Usage:-

Enter a research topic in the web interface or through the API.
The system will autonomously run its search, analysis, and writing agents.
Download the generated research report in PDF or HTML format.


Security:-

API key-based authentication for backend endpoints.
Restricted crawler behavior to comply with robots.txt guidelines.
Sanitized data pipelines to prevent injection attacks.


AI Agents:-

The AI agents are designed to work both independently and collaboratively:
Search Agent uses APIs and crawlers for data gathering.
Analysis Agent uses NLP for summarization and fact extraction.
Writing Agent formats findings into structured, citation-backed reports.
Indexing Agent stores data for instant retrieval.
